# Slack MCP Server - TODO

## Phase 1: Essential Operations (Do First)

- **File upload** - Critical for sharing content
- **File list/info** - View and manage files
- **Schedule message** - Time-based communications

## Phase 2: Enhanced Organization

- **Pin/unpin messages** - Content highlighting
- **Add/list bookmarks** - Resource organization
- **Invite users to channel** - Membership management

## Phase 3: Productivity Features

- **Add/list reminders** - Task management
- **Set/clear user status** - Presence management
- **List scheduled messages** - Scheduled message management

## Things to Skip (For Now)

- **Canvas documents** - Complex, newer feature, limited use cases
- **Custom emoji management** - Admin-only, niche
- **Workflow Builder** - Enterprise feature, complex
- **Huddles API** - Limited API access, complex real-time requirements

## Notes

- File Operations Suite: upload, list, info, delete
- Channel Management Suite: create, archive, set topic/purpose, invite
- Scheduled Messages: schedule, list, delete
- Pins & Bookmarks: add, list, remove for both

These additions would give us comprehensive Slack functionality that covers 90% of typical AI assistant needs. The file operations alone would be a game-changer since sharing documents/images is such a common requirement.
